      It's not uncommon to be surprised by how long it can take to set up a new computer or mobile phone. Installing new software, transferring data from an old device, downloading all necessary updates, and setting up desired configurations can sometimes prove to be an exhausting process. Even calibrating your TV's color settings (which are optimized for store display by default) to match the lighting conditions in your own living room can challenge even the most tech-savvy individuals.
